JavaWoolz: A Java binding to the Woolz Image Processing System

If building JavaWoolz then the build requires all the Woolz libraries
(including external file format libraries such as Jpeg, NIfTI and Tiff)
to be built with relocatable code (use -fPIC with gcc).

A prefix can be given in the configure stage to define where the programs,
libraries are will be installed, conventionally this is /opt/MouseAtlas.
Use

./configure --help

to see all the options available.

See the script build.sh for typical configuration options.
